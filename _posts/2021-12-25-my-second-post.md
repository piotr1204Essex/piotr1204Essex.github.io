## Summary post of collaborative discussion 1

This post is meant to summarize some of the key concepts I have learned within Collaborative Discussion with my peers

There are many opinions and questions in regards to the future of data science as a field. How will the demand of the job market change? How can we factor in our analytics ethics? How do we define ethics in data science? Will the job become easier or harder? Which skills will play the most important role in the data science field?

I am thrilled to have had the possibility of engaging in a discussion with my peers. Most of us, myself included, agree that the future of the job will definitely involve more soft skills (Wong, 2022). I personally argue that it is not going to be at the expense of hard skills (Sieminski, 2022), however others have different opinions. It is clear nevertheless that business leaders need data scientists to be able to cooperate and communicate effectively with a variety of stakeholders, adapting their vocabulary to the audience. 

It seems that most agree that the data science job market will not shrink within 5 years (Boesh, 2022). I also agree with this point (Sieminski, 2022), considering this horizon mid-term. As argued above, the definition and required skills will change, however the demand will remain high. It is only the question who can actually perform the job with new requirements? In the long-term horizon however, I agree in principle, that the job market may shrink and salaries get lower (Sieminski, 2022). 

One of the hardest questions is ethics within the field. There doesn’t seem to be a general consensus apart from the fact that ethics in this field are of utmost importance. How to go about it moving forward is a question we keep debating on (Williams, 2022). I personally argue that assembling an association resembling a Bar Association or a Medical Board that would hold data scientists accountable on the grounds of ethics, might be the way forward (Sieminski, 2022).
