#### Collaborative Discussion 1: The 4th Industrial Revolution

##### Initial Post

The topics discussed in Schwab's (2017) book on the fourth industrial revolution concern a sector I am involved in professionally - that is Big Data. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence cannot be created or work or exist or provide any value without the data that fuels them. It is fair to say that the significant advancements in ML and AI fields are made available thanks to the exponential increase in the data we collect globally, as humanity (Anon, 2022).

The availability of big data enables organisations to operate and scale more efficiently. With the increased reliance on data there is a growing risk of an incident with serious repercussions, should the data become unavailable, for whatever reason.

This brings me to a specific incident where information systems failed: the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack (Julia Carrie Wong and Solon, 2017). This attack focused on encrypting organisations’ data and demanding a ransom in order for them to regain access. For private businesses this had widespread consequences that affected business continuity and resulted in monetary losses. Unfortunately also government organisations have been a target, with the UK’s NHS patients suffering, arguably, the most having thousands of their appointments cancelled and others having experienced disrupted patient care. This shows how important and crucial asset data is. By restricting access to it, malicious actors have caused pain and suffering - for NHS’s patients, monetary loss for businesses, disrupted usage of products of many companies (arguably the lowest level impact) by their customers and caused a significant reputational cost to all of the organisations affected. The failure of the systems that were hacked lays within the lack of proper cyber security measures that should have prevented attackers from gaining access to the data in the first place.

This example clearly proves that with great power, that big data gives us, huge responsibility comes. I like to think about it in a similar way one could think about household finances. The lower the number of streams of income, the higher reliance factor is associated with every single source of income, the higher risk of defaulting on household payments. If we, as humanity, continuously increase reliance on data and information systems - we must be prepared for an increased risk of “defaulting” on the delivery promised by these information systems.
