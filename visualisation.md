Tasks undertaken

Ryanair - See destinations available from my hometown

Ryanair - Book a flight from my hometown

EasyJet - See destinations available from my hometown

EasyJet - Book a flight from my hometown

Data presentation

Ryanair - Marks:

Ryanair - Dots/points for airports

Ryanair - Curves for routes from one airport to another

Ryanair - CTA boxes to book a flight

Ryanair - Lines for shape of countries

Channels:

Ryanair - Map positioning (country shapes, border marks)

Ryanair - Different colour saturation/scale for land and sea

Marks:

EasyJet - Dots/points for airports

EasyJet - Curves for routes from one airport to another

EasyJet - CTA boxes to book a flight

EasyJet - Lines for shape of countries

Channels:

EasyJet - Map positioning (country shapes, border marks)

EasyJet - Different colour saturation/scale for land and sea

Colour Schema

Ryanair - Airports are marks of yellow (as Ryanair's colours) and then land and sea are a different shade of blue; borders are in black.

EasyJet - Airports are orange marks, land is using a terrain scale showing mountains or other land peculiarities with different colours (white, green etc.); sea is blue and borders are in black.

Limitations

Ryanair - Might be hard to distinguish different countries (for people who do not know the map of europe but want to fly to any town in France eg. it might be hard)

EasyJet - Visualisation is too crowded and very confusing with popping lines - I am not sure where it leads from and too - map size is definitely too small

Strengths

Ryanair - Easiness of finding where Ryanair flies to from selected city

Ryanair - Calm colour palette with easily distinguishable airports

Ryanair - CTA button available as soon as destination is chosen

Ryanair - Not showing cities names - only airports, to clean the view for user


 

EasyJet - Showing all destinations from an airport at ones (via the route lines)

EasyJet - Hard to identify any other strengths

My Views

Ryanair - The visualisation provided by Ryanair serves as a useful tool to see where they can fly you from selected town, makes the booking process easy, the colour palette is calm, the visualisation provides maximum information needed to make a decision but does not overload user at the same time

EasyJet - The visualisation provided by EasyJet is very crowded, looks like it was from a previous century. It is super confusing to find what I want to do there as well as I am not sure about the usage of trip details box combined with map selection - seems as the two are detached from one another

### Summary post

In summary, the Ryanair page seems much better to use than EasyJet's one. The data visualisation methods applied on Ryanair's page are not only serving its purpose - allowing user to take the action but are also calm and pleasant for the user's eye. EasyJet, on the other hand, provides a very small map with overload of information. It is causing confusion and, in my personal opinion, may distract the users from the task they want to perform. Both of the designs, although similar in the architecture, differ tremendously in the execution.

## Reflective piece 

Introduction
In this document I will reflect on several topics in which I advanced over the course of this module. I have used Tableau prior to enrolling in this module for private purposes, which put me in a better position than I would have been had I had to start learning this tool and data visualisation from scratch. I have, however, learned some new skills and received valuable feedback from the Professor teaching this module.
Data Analysis Skills
The programming exercise we had to submit as a first assignment has allowed me to improve EDA. I have spent a considerable amount of time reading articles on Medium (Medium), which is a well-respected source for data professionals (Avcontentteam, 2016). It has shown me different approaches to single and bivariate analysis. I like to think that this exercise has helped to shape my brain when it comes to an ‘algorithm’ I follow now, when approaching an EDA task. That means - what are the steps I need to follow in order to find some actionable insights from the raw data set? 

When I was a kid, my mum used to tell me that one of the best values of University courses is that they teach you how to approach a problem. When you know how to approach it, you are half way through it. I am confident to say that this is exactly what I gained over the course of this module, when it comes to data visualisation.

Probably the biggest challenge with EDA is the tediousness of exploration. It can become tiresome and a long process. If EDA does not yield any interesting results within the first few variables that you hypothesised they should have, it becomes hard, for me, to continue with the same level of motivation. 
Statistical and ML Knowledge
I was surprised how uncomplicated it may be to create simple machine learning algorithms. I am aware that machine learning is a field with tremendous possibilities and getting advanced in that field requires a lot of time and learning. Nevertheless, I like to think about it in a similar way one can think of any other skill. Ebbinghaus’ learning curve theory (Valamis, 2023) clearly shows that the progress rate is huge within the first ~10-20% of attempts made at mastering a skill. After that it significantly slows down. What it tells me, is that even if I do not want to become an expert in statistics and machine learning, I can gain a relatively huge amount of knowledge and proficiency with 10-20% of the time an expert would spend to learn the whole thing. It motivates me tremendously. I thoroughly enjoyed working with regression analysis and seeing how much leverage statistics and machine learning gives us when provided with sufficient data. 
Tableau for data visualisation
As I mentioned in the introduction, Tableau was not a new tool for me. When it comes to experience with using Tableau, I would say it’s probably the most powerful tool that I have ever seen. The number of visualisations, granularity, customisation it offers is enormous. At first, it might not come as the most intuitive tool, but once one finds their way around it, it allows them to quickly create beautifully designed and powerful dashboards. 

I like the ease of connecting Tableau to different data sources as well as all functions that support data interpretations. I also enjoyed the fact that I could modify the data already uploaded to Tableau (change data type, create hierarchy etc.). 

Tableau has also a great community online (Tableau Community Forums) as well as extensive documentation which makes it easy to apply any visualisation you want. 
Python for data visualisation
My personal preferences do not lay in using programming languages for data visualisation (like Python or R). On one hand there is an almost unlimited number of possibilities for customisation. On the other hand it requires much more skill and knowledge than Tableau does. Also finding information online on how to visualise something will have many answers and usually not one centralised source. Using libraries such as seaborn (Statistical Data Visualization) allows you to use the open source documentation, but it is not the case for everything you want to do in python. Nevertheless, I find it still much harder than finding information related to Tableau visualisations.

Over the course of this module, I have enjoyed, however, the statistical visualisations created with Python. Most impressive for me was the ROC curve that I created for the machine learning model from Programming Exercise. 

Overall, in my experience it is much easier to use Tableau for data visualisation, when you have a clean data set which requires (almost) nothing more than to be visualised. At maximum a few small tweaks on a column or data type level. When you are presented with a dataset that requires extensive data transformations or explorations first, before building any visualisation (or machine learning model) then Python would be my obvious choice. Although harder to implement, I cannot imagine downloading a .csv file every time I have a pandas’ data frame I want to explore, then uploading it to Tableau and only then seeing what’s happening with my data. 

The summary of this section, coming from my experience over the course of this module, is as follows: use Tableau when you have a clean data set and want to present it to business stakeholders, but use Python when you need to explore, modify the data, or train machine learning algorithms and assess their performance. 
Summary
After this module I feel confident with using data visualisation and exploration techniques. There are many more things to learn, but I gained the knowledge on how to approach problems and where to look for solutions. All of this together makes me comfortable to face any real-world visualisation task.
