Ryanair - CTA boxes to book a flight

Ryanair - Lines for shape of countries

Channels:

Ryanair - Different colour saturation/scale for land and sea

Marks:

EasyJet - Dots/points for airports

EasyJet - Curves for routes from one airport to another

EasyJet - CTA boxes to book a flight

EasyJet - Lines for shape of countries

Channels:

EasyJet - Map positioning (country shapes, border marks)

EasyJet - Different colour saturation/scale for land and sea

Colour Schema

Ryanair - Airports are marks of yellow (as Ryanair's colours) and then land and sea are a different shade of blue; borders are in black.

EasyJet - Airports are orange marks, land is using a terrain scale showing mountains or other land peculiarities with different colours (white, green etc.); sea is blue and borders are in black.

Limitations

Ryanair - Might be hard to distinguish different countries (for people who do not know the map of europe but want to fly to any town in France eg. it might be hard)

EasyJet - Visualisation is too crowded and very confusing with popping lines - I am not sure where it leads from and too - map size is definitely too small

Strengths

Ryanair - Easiness of finding where Ryanair flies to from selected city

Ryanair - Calm colour palette with easily distinguishable airports

Ryanair - CTA button available as soon as destination is chosen

Ryanair - Not showing cities names - only airports, to clean the view for user


 

EasyJet - Showing all destinations from an airport at ones (via the route lines)

EasyJet - Hard to identify any other strengths

My Views

Ryanair - The visualisation provided by Ryanair serves as a useful tool to see where they can fly you from selected town, makes the booking process easy, the colour palette is calm, the visualisation provides maximum information needed to make a decision but does not overload user at the same time

EasyJet - The visualisation provided by EasyJet is very crowded, looks like it was from a previous century. It is super confusing to find what I want to do there as well as I am not sure about the usage of trip details box combined with map selection - seems as the two are detached from one another

### Summary post

In summary, the Ryanair page seems much better to use than EasyJet's one. The data visualisation methods applied on Ryanair's page are not only serving its purpose - allowing user to take the action but are also calm and pleasant for the user's eye. EasyJet, on the other hand, provides a very small map with overload of information. It is causing confusion and, in my personal opinion, may distract the users from the task they want to perform. Both of the designs, although similar in the architecture, differ tremendously in the execution.
