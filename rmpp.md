## Collaborative discussions
### Collaborative Learning Discussion 1
#### Initial post
I have chosen to review the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018). Blocker Plus serves, in my opinion, a crucial role in children’s safety when browsing the internet. It is intended to block the content that is legally protected by the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA, 2000).

The issue at hand is that the machine learning based algorithm started to block the content that was not explicitly prohibited by the CIPA. Which raises a question: what has caused such behaviour? The algorithm was intentionally misled by a group of people acting with a purpose such that specific information was parsed to the algorithm in order to be marked as harmful for children. Amongst several topics being blocked, was information about gay and lesbian marriages. Not only was this topic not prohibited by CIPA, but it has also been found that age-appropriate sexual education is beneficial for children (Breuner et al., 2016).

This situation raises important questions related to legal and social issues as well as the professionalism of the Blocker Plus’ development team. One of the logical provisions of the law is that whatever is not forbidden, must be allowed. Looking from this angle, the development team would have done nothing wrong. This is where the ethics come in and why they are so important in computing professionals practice (and many others). The Blocker Plus, as indicated in the case study analysis, has failed to meet several ethics code principles. In essence, it has failed to provide sufficient security which in turn made the product not serve its intended purpose. With the products of such importance, which is protection of children from harmful content, one can argue that making such products work exactly as intended is a matter of the highest priority. 

The social impact of the issue, apart from distrust of the customers, can also be a delayed sexual education for children, which might have a negative effect on their knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases or increase the risks of adolescent pregnancy (Breuner et al., 2016).

The development team has failed to meet the ethics code principles, some of them being very similar to BCS Code of Conduct (BCS). For example, the aforementioned issue related to sexual education, violates rule number 1. of the public interest section, which states clearly that you shall have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment. Rule number 3. of the same section, clearly prohibits from discrimination. In the case of blocking gay and lesbian marriages information, it can constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation, which again, is against the BCS code of conduct. 

While I believe that none of the shortcomings Blocker Plus’ system had were put in there intentionally, it is the outcome that matters. Unfortunately the outcome was a material breach of several ethics code principles as well as BCS code of conduct.

#### Summary Post

After reviewing the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018) I have shared my views and opinions in the initial post, to which I got one reply (Dervishev, 2023) posing a question about potential application of gestures in a machine learning algorithm that would be able to estimate user's age and based on this apply a filter to the content accessed on a given device (Pulfrey & Hossain, 2022).

This question opens further considerations to what was explained in initial post, and my personal opinion is that this feature could be of a great usage - if properly applied, however it can be very tricky and potentially cost the companies its customers, if the rate of error would be too large. I am considering here a legally sane adult (in the eyes of the law) who would like to enter websites where, for example, alcohol is sold. Such adult might get frustrated if they are denied access and have no way of switching off this child-protection algorithm. Therefore it is crucial that such considerations are made before rolling out the product for the wider use. 

To sum up the discussion in this thread, we all agree that tools for protecting children in the internet are needed. Some content should simply not be accessible for them, as indicated by Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) in the US. It is however crucial that such systems are provided with sufficient capabilities as to be protected from malicious attacks such that they are not infected with content the children should not see, or that the children are restricted access too, although they should not be. They should also allow for actual adults to switch off any restrictions if they are incorrectly applied to an adult by an algorithm which determined the user is a child.

### Collaborative Learning Discussion 2
#### Initial post

When it comes to Abi’s concerns, first of all, there is no justification, whatsoever, for changing the data values - this is, to simply put it: fraud. Providing misleading information, especially when it comes to the commercials which reach the general public, is punishable by law in Poland (Dz.U.2022.0.1138 t.j - Kodeks karny) with a prison sentence from 3 months minimum to 5 years maximum. Apart from that, one can also face an immediate dismissal at their workplace. Not to mention the social impact of marketing based on false data. Commercials which reach millions of people, can mislead millions of people and hence have a tremendous impact on eg. public health. In Abi’s case we learned that Whizzz cereal may be harmful. It is scary to imagine if that turned out to be true - we could have overcrowded hospitals (in the worst-case scenario) for the mistake of this one person falsifying data reports.

Statistics are an extremely powerful tool, when used appropriately. They provide a variety of tools and techniques for data handling that allow a data professional to extract meaningful insights from even a ‘messy’ dataset (Grilli et al., 2023). However, when used inappropriately, they can skew results, hide important facts and mislead the reader. Therefore I believe that Abi shall choose the best suited tools and correlations for the task at hand, as objectively as possible, to the best of his knowledge, and these should be the ones making it to the report, regardless of whichever side they support. 

When it comes to responsibility, I wholeheartedly believe that the responsibility would lay with Abi only if he knowingly provided inaccurate results, or the ones achieved without following the ethics. One cannot be blamed for misinterpretation of their work by others, as long as one has provided accurate information, presented in a way which suggests correct interpretation of the results beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore it is within Abi’s best interest to follow the ethics, provide the results along with their correct interpretation. This - I believe - is the only ethical course of action in Abi’s situation.

## Unit 1 - Reflective Activity

The pdf format of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/unit_1_reflective_activity.pdf)

### Tutor feedback:

- It is good to see you cite regularly in the early stages of the formative, ensure that you continue to do this for all future formative and summative but cite all the way through your discussion
- When using a quote, cite immediately after it [reference where the quote came from]. Do this in all instances
- Your citation thins out from section 3 onwards - you need to cite in every paragraph and draw theoretical discussion through the whole of the formative. Taking this approach means you develop a critical method of writing. You need to regularly compare pros and cons of research and investigation for criticality to occur, other wise your writing is descriptive
- Your list of references needs to be in alphabetical order

The main point is the issue of criticality and citation, and so don't merely interpret the research you have found - analyse and evaluate your research look at the limitations and positives of your research and develop your critical discussion from that aspect.

#### Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing

##### 1. Introduction
I have been tasked with reviewing Stahl et al (2016) as well as Bott (2014) Chapter 1. Stahl et al (2016) writes that many of the papers researching ethical issues in computing “fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders”. The task at hand is to imagine being a computing stakeholder at a company of choice and to examine one or more ethical issues mentioned in Stahl et al (2016) paper. Bott (2014) provides an overview and introduction into what law is, primarily focusing on the legislative and jurisdiction processes in the UK and in the US.

For the purpose of this task, I will choose to be a Software Engineer at Apple Inc.. The choice of the company aims to provide the reader with a very well-known company globally, which products the reader may have used in the past or is using currently. The choice of a Software Engineer is also aiming at providing a simple point of reference as to the scope of the work required by such professionals (Shweta et al, 2022). I will also generalise the daily tasks of a Software Engineer at Apple. It is important to note, that I do not have full information of what a day-to-day of a Software Engineer at Apple entails (as that is confidential). 

This task has no strict word count limit, however it is recommended to create a submission of a length of approximately 2/3 pages (around 1000 words).

##### 2. Ethical issues choice
The ethical issues I chose start with a widely discussed privacy issue (Zimmer, 2010) and the usage of user collected data for reasons the users may have not provided a specific consent. This brings a question of “what an online consent really is” (Varnhagen et al, 2005). It is worth noting that the two papers in no way will represent the full range of ethical issues involved with mentioned topics but rather provide a high level, introductory view on them. As tempting as it is to delve further on the topic, I must keep in mind the advised word limit for this paper.

##### 3. Effect of ethical issues on my role in the company and actions to be taken
First thing that comes to mind is the security of the software that I will produce. When it comes to privacy, the first and most important task is to secure any information that we collect from the users. I can therefore make a security and penetration testing review mandatory, before shipping any piece of code. 

Once I make sure that the information is protected, it should be reviewing what is actually the information that the software collects and whether or not the user has given their informed consent for collection of said data. In order to define what an “informed” consent really is, I shall refer the reader to the definition provided within the field of Medicine, where it is well established, practised and enforced by law for decades (Gossman et al, 2022). It is of a great significance not only to receive the consent, but also that it is an informed one. For this reason, I shall establish a process for reviewing any piece of code that changes in any way any of the information collected and evaluate such changes against the ethics code first. If there are no internal guidelines for ethics within the company, I shall propose to the management to establish one. 

Once the developed code meets the ethics standard, I shall work with UX/UI designers and copywriters to create a new consent request to the user which will be delivered in a way that allows them to make an informed decision. Such consent prompt shall appear prior to collecting any new information to which the consent has not been previously granted.

For all the above-mentioned processes I shall not only incorporate them in my tasks, but also make sure that the management adheres to them and sets appropriate structures, procedures and processes in place that allow for their execution by other software engineers as well. 

##### 4. Legal, social and professional impact of the aforementioned actions
###### 4.1. Legal impact
The Federal Trade Commission in the US is a body which can fine Apple, if they do not adhere to the actions in regards to eg. informed consent. The same goes for privacy and data collection as shown by several precedents (Richie et al, 2022). When it comes to collecting data from users within the EU, if Apple was not to adhere to GDPR standards when collecting and handling user data, they could be fined up to “€20 mln or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher”. The aforementioned actions are some of the ways to prevent such fines.

###### 4.2 Social Impact
Providing a clear, informed consent structure to the user prior to collecting their data may greatly influence customer’s experience and hence brand’s trust, which may be profitable for Apple (Meng Na et al, 2023). It will also allow the users to feel more secure knowing that they consented to the data that is collected on Apple’s devices but also by being sure that their data is well protected from exploitation. 

###### 4.3 Professional impact
The impact of introducing new/additional procedures and checks as well as involving other experts when eg. creating a new consent prompt, will have its costs. The most visible impact will be longer code shipping time - if the code has to undergo additional, sometimes complex checks before being released to the production environment, it is natural that the release process will take longer. It does also impose on the management the responsibility for governing the processes themselves as well as to “police” in some way, making sure that those who do not adhere to the procedures will be fined. It is crucial that Apple finds the right balance between punishment and turning a blind eye on the issue. It is also important that the employees feel inspired to follow these processes (do not follow them out of fear per se) as well as to report lack of someone’s adherence to them. 

##### Summary
Ethics in Computing are becoming increasingly important as the technology develops and more aspects of human life are in some shape or form digitalised. This paper provided a high level overview on the ethical issues related to data collection and privacy, while highlighting impact on legal, social and professional issues. Companies, like Apple, adhering to the ethics code may see slower release times and potential impact on their revenues initially, however the increased customer’s trust and brand loyalty may compensate for such a loss with a significant surplus. It does appear therefore, that there is no reason, not even financial one, not to adhere to ethics code in computing.

## Unit 3 - Research Proposal Review

At the end of Unit 3 of the module, we have been asked the following question:

_Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
Which data collection methods would you consider using?_

This piece of writing is to be considered as my personal thoughts and hence it will have a less academic form and will rather describe my thought process and considerations.
After assessing accessible topics for literature review from Unit 1 I have decided that I would like to focus my attention on the following topic: “What is the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the country of your choice?” 

The choice of the topic comes from the fact that not only is this an interesting question in and of itself, but also the technology sector has its peculiarities which might give very different answers to the gender pay gap question compared to if it was to be assessed in another industry. The technology sector, for example, does not require formal education (Gregory, 2022). Also, from my professional experience, I have often seen women earn the same, sometimes even more than men, for doing the same kind of work, within the technology sector. The gender pay gap question, generally assumes that the gap  is structured in such a way that men earn more than women (European Parliament, 2020). While this might be true globally, the literature review question is very specific about the technology sector. Having mentioned my professional experiences it is an extremely interesting topic for me to discover. I wonder if the gap exists in the technology sector, and if so, is it the same, smaller or maybe higher than somewhere else? Is it men who earn more or maybe women? What could be the causes for that?

I am still considering which country I want to review, but the US market seems like the most interesting one. The reason for that is that the gender pay gap there (Greenwood, 2023) seems to be as high as within the highest countries of the EU (European Parliament, 2020). The US market is also paying the most for the tech jobs (Philips, 2022) which creates more possibilities for the pay gap. My thinking here is that the more an individual can earn on average, the higher the standard deviation. That is an assumption I will also look to confirm or disprove.

When it comes to the methods I think the best would be to apply quantitative methods for this particular research. Reason being, that it might be hard to do qualitative research (unless some found online) as I am not physically present in the US. The gender pay gap question also can be primarily answered with numbers. Even the question contains the word ‘gap’ which indicates that a gap must be measured in some way, and quantitative research allows us to get the best guess at a true gap. Qualitative research could be very useful when it comes to understanding the reasons for the gap (if one is proven to exist). If I, however, won’t be able to find eligible respondents online, I will need to review the literature from the realm of psychology, which could, potentially, help me understand the reasons behind a gap (if one is proven to exist). Therefore the data collection would be mostly from publications and statistics, but also, if proven to be possible, some kind of survey that could be answered by eligible respondents and give more insights into the research. 

To sum this up, I do feel that this is an extremely interesting topic and I am looking forward to reviewing the literature and finding answers to all of the aforementioned questions.

### Tutor feedback:

Thank you for submitting your formative.

Noted that you speak of two definitions in the context of your discussion:

1) All technology jobs regardless of the profile of a company
2) All jobs (regardless of the job profile) within a tech company

For the Literature review choose one of these as you only have 2,000 words to discuss this. Similarly when
answering the Literature Review don’t break it down into too many subsections, again because you only
have 2,000. Keep the content concise and focused. Good to see you have started to add citation – ensure
for the actual Literature Review, that you ensure you have a good cross-section of secondary research
resources to enable effective critical debate to take place.

### Submission

For the literature review I have selected the following question: “What is the gender pay gap
in the technology sector in the country of your choice?” with my country of choice being the
United States of America.

The first thing I would like to discuss in my literature review is the definition of the question.
More specifically, what does it exactly mean “the technology sector”. For me it means
technology jobs in technology firms. There exist however two different definitions:

1) All technology jobs regardless of the profile of a company
2) All jobs (regardless of the job profile) within a tech company
   
I find it extraordinarily important to clarify this first and foremost, as such distinction will
have a profound impact on the actual research. Following the definitions, I would state my
personal hypothesis about the gender wage gap in the technology sector in the US.

Once I clarify this and other terms (where necessary) I would like to move on to introduce a
bit of history and related legislation, in order to provide a wider context for the review and
subsequent research. I would like to review The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Equal Pay Act of
1963) and some of the historical data. Later on, I would like to introduce the timeframe
within which the literature review will take place. It is crucial to select a proper timeline and
to introduce the reader into the reasons behind such selection. As the technology sector is
rapidly growing and expanding, so are the jobs and pay within that sector (Sadler, 2023).
I am leaning towards looking at the last 5 years of data, which is motivated by the
aforementioned growth of the sector. It has also been the COVID-19 pandemic that has
affected the pay and the work set up, productivity and others greatly (Patanjali et al., 2022)
which is another reason for such a short time frame selection.

I would then proceed to the classification of academic sources to be reviewed. The
classification would likely follow a hierarchical structure, with the first and most important
distinction being the literature on actual measurements vs the literature on reasons behind the
gender pay gap or its social ramifications.

After classification, the summary of the reviewed literature should be produced, together with
key takeaways. Assessment of the initial hypothesis, summary of the key factors contributing
to the gender pay gap and so on and so forth.

It will be important to then review actions taken by corporations that aim to reduce the gender
wage gap and assess their effectiveness. Following this paragraph, I would like to discuss the
limitations and any shortcomings of the existing literature on the topic, along with
highlighting what could be the most useful area of research which would improve the state of
existing literature.

I would, subsequently, proceed to the conclusions section, with summary of the literature
review as a whole, as well as key takeaways for society to take into account for the future.

### Unit 4 Case Study on Privacy
In Unit 4 we were given a case study (University of Essex, 2023) with intriguing questions to come up with answers to. Privacy is a key part of ethical considerations in academic research (Dawson, 2015). I would like therefore to answer each of the questions and give them the necessary attention. 

First and foremost, when it comes to privacy and data protection, there are legislative requirements to ensure safety and protection of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from external researchers and anyone else who does not have the right to access such data (GDPR, 2016). In the given case, Ricardo is not the person responsible for determining allowable access and therefore he should not release the PII data requested under no circumstances. It would have to be processed and approved by a legal department of Ricardo’s institution first.

Assuming that Ricardo is actually responsible for determining allowable access to the requested PII data, there are still very important ethical considerations to be done. On one hand, the researcher asks for the PII data in order to be able to request approval for further processing of the data from specific homeowners. This action alone is the correct approach when selecting a population sample to study (Dawson, 2015). What is problematic however, is that this data is not publicly accessible. In order to access this data, it must be retrieved from a stored and protected government database. These people might not want this data to be released in the first place and this is the biggest ethical concern.

For the last question, we shall assume that the institution holding the PII data and the researcher have followed the ethics code (Polish Academy of Sciences, 2020) when making the information accessible to Beth. Given the described scenario, where one-third of the population studied gave permission, one-third denied and one-third did not respond, there are very few options left for Beth. Since she does need at least one-half of the individuals to make a valid study, an attempt can be made to follow up with the group that has given no response. It goes without saying that Beth should not contact the individuals who denied again. This seems as far as Beth can go with the current data available.

There exists another solution which would be to ask the local government to release more names (if possible, following the same ethics standards as before). If that was not to be possible, then Beth should inform the individuals who gave consent, that the study cannot be concluded due to not enough respondents giving their consent. Subsequently Beth could move the study to another, possibly greater area, where the population size is higher and therefore the relative share of the population needed to make a valid study could be proportionally smaller. 

Following the ethics code (Polish Academy of Sciences, 2020) is not only crucial to successful research but is also a complex task. One must be aware of all implications of one’s actions. Even if, as described in the third paragraph, requesting consent for the study is the proper, ethical approach, there remains the question how does one access the names and/or other PII data necessary to request such consent. Such situations shall be studied with care and give proper attention in order to make sure that the ethical standards are upheld at all times.

### Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

#### Introduction

The Cambridge Analytica case, as described by N. Confessore (Confessore, 2018) is presumably the first ever use of personal data on scale to inform a political campaign (build voter profiles, to be exact). I was tasked to consider how this could have happened and why it was used. The particular attention should be drawn to the use of innocuous Facebook surveys, as requested in the case study description. As I would like to keep this case study apolitical and strictly case-focused, I will refrain from naming any specific political party. I will focus on a general use case of such voter profiles and then proceed to discuss the ‘how’ and the ‘what for’ questions. 

#### What is a ‘voter’s profile’?

I would like to start with the definition of the voter’s profile. I like to think about it in a similar way as data professionals think about customer personas (Gilliland, 2017). It is a set of attributes which are used to group users into cohorts that are meant to be representative of a population. Such simplification can enhance any marketing (or political campaign) efforts. It makes it easier for a human to visualise and conceptualise an imaginary person (profile) as if they were standing in front of them. This makes it much easier to deliver the content that such a person is likely to want to hear. 

The concept of targeted marketing (buyer persona) has been around since 1999 (Zambito, 2010) and has since evolved significantly. Customer profiling (Loshin et al., 2013) can enhance understanding of a company’s users (Jansen et al., 2020) in the same way as a voter's profile can enhance a candidate’s understanding of the people who might or might not vote for them. It is therefore clear that there is a tremendous value in possessing such a voter's profile. The issue begins where we start looking into how the source data for profiling has been collected. 

#### How was the data accessed?

The case study description suggests (University of Essex, 2023) that the data used by Cambridge Analytica was taken mainly from Facebook surveys. In reality, it has been harvested from Facebook in one of the biggest data leaks in history (Confessore, 2018). Now that we have a clear understanding of where the data comes from, let us consider how that happened. I will leave to cyber security specialists any detailed analysis on how exactly this much data could have been harvested from secure Facebook servers and I will focus on the surveys mentioned in the case study description (University of Essex, 2023).

As N. Confessore rightly points out (Confessore, 2018): ‘You are the product’. In the evolving world and the Internet of Things reality, we share more and more of our data. Often unconsciously, sometimes by mistake but rarely with a pure intention, making informed decisions to supply our information to create profiling for monetary, political or any other gains. If something is for free it is likely that we are the product (Roy, 2018) and more precisely the information about us. I believe the participation in said surveys took place only because they looked innocuous, hence no one suspected that it might be used for informing a political campaign. 

#### Target pregnancy prediction model

Another example of a misuse of surveys and a variety of other data sources about a customer can be found within one of the biggest chain stores in the US: Target. Target has made the headlines when the company became ‘aware’ of a teen girl being pregnant before her father did (Hill, 2012). This information was predicted by Target’s ML model being trained on vast amounts of data and creating customer profiles in return - similar to those described at the beginning of this paper. 

It is self-explanatory that for-profit companies exist indeed for profit and therefore are always finding new ways to increase their sales and margins. When it comes to data, however, the ethics question comes to mind immediately, especially in the case of a teen pregnancy described above. We, as a society, have recognised that with growing accessibility of personalised data there is a growing ethical responsibility (Hemker et al., 2021). We shall look forward to seeing how this can be implemented on scale.

#### Summary

Inappropriate use of surveys is unethical in its definition. If it is inappropriate, then it is almost certainly unethical. It can have profound social and legal implications. In the case of Cambridge Analytica (Confessore, 2018), the misuse has triggered investigations from the highest structures of government in both the US and the UK. The world had seen Mark Zuckerberg (the Facebook CEO) in front of the congress. The 2016 US election was questioned by many (Auchard, 2018). These are only a few of the legal implications such an inappropriate use of surveys can have. 

It is not free from social and professional implications either. In Target's case we have learned about customers being ‘creeped out’ by the algorithm (Hill, 2012), which can negatively impact customer’s trust to the brand and to the industry in general, which in turn can have overall negative effects on the economy. Needless to say what social impact can cause an election that is questioned. It can lead to mass protests, sometimes violent (Kishi et al., 2020). It can lead to periods without a government which again, can negatively impact a country’s economy and various other aspects of social life. 

It is therefore clear that inappropriate use of surveys and other kinds of data has all sorts of negative implications, which we shall avoid at all costs.

## Unit 6 Formative Activities

### e-Portfolio update: Data Collection

I have chosen to focus on the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the US. Because of that, I can see three main data collection tools which will be useful for my area of investigation. 

First and foremost it would be quantitative data pulled from official sources, such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, 2023). This will be the skeleton and the raw facts on which further investigation can be based. I would like to perform a statistical analysis on this data in order to validate the initial hypothesis (yet to be formulated) and check for statistical significance of the data provided (Schwen et al., 2018). Ideally, I would be able to identify clear tendencies in the data which will guide further questions.

Once raw facts are established, well defined and presented, the following data collection tools can be applied to enhance the understanding of the factual data: interviews and surveys (Ongena et al., 2020). These tools can prove very useful when trying to make sense of the numerical information. As we are human beings and we all have emotions, feelings, experiences that guide our careers (Emmerling et al., 2003) in one or the other way, it would be important to understand if the gaps (if existent) in wages can be explained by differences in psyche, approach to the workplace or maybe childhood experiences.

I would like to leverage surveys in order to be able not only to reach a bigger sample of respondents but also to ensure that the key questions are indeed answered. The surveys will allow me to make sure that at least a given set of questions is answered in some way. Even if the respondents mark an inconclusive answer (like ‘other’ with no further detail) this will still be a valuable insight for me, that maybe the question was written in a wrong way or is actually not that important (Jeong et al., 2022).

When it comes to interviews, they will be extremely helpful in getting more context (Philipps et al., 2019) to both the factual and survey response data. I would like to use this opportunity to ask further ‘why?’ questions and dive as deep as possible into some of the concepts that may impact the gaps (if existent) in wages. I would like to analyse these interviews in such a way that would allow for categorising the answers, which might be tough. If that was to prove to be impossible or highly unreliable, I would use them as supportive evidence, with clear information how the data is collected and that it should not be treated as views of a certain population sample but rather as individual views and opinions which can help understand the gender wage gap (if existent).
