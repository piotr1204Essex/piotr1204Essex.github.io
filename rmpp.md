## Collaborative discussions
### Collaborative Learning Discussion 1
#### Initial post
I have chosen to review the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018). Blocker Plus serves, in my opinion, a crucial role in children’s safety when browsing the internet. It is intended to block the content that is legally protected by the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA, 2000).

The issue at hand is that the machine learning based algorithm started to block the content that was not explicitly prohibited by the CIPA. Which raises a question: what has caused such behaviour? The algorithm was intentionally misled by a group of people acting with a purpose such that specific information was parsed to the algorithm in order to be marked as harmful for children. Amongst several topics being blocked, was information about gay and lesbian marriages. Not only was this topic not prohibited by CIPA, but it has also been found that age-appropriate sexual education is beneficial for children (Breuner et al., 2016).

This situation raises important questions related to legal and social issues as well as the professionalism of the Blocker Plus’ development team. One of the logical provisions of the law is that whatever is not forbidden, must be allowed. Looking from this angle, the development team would have done nothing wrong. This is where the ethics come in and why they are so important in computing professionals practice (and many others). The Blocker Plus, as indicated in the case study analysis, has failed to meet several ethics code principles. In essence, it has failed to provide sufficient security which in turn made the product not serve its intended purpose. With the products of such importance, which is protection of children from harmful content, one can argue that making such products work exactly as intended is a matter of the highest priority. 

The social impact of the issue, apart from distrust of the customers, can also be a delayed sexual education for children, which might have a negative effect on their knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases or increase the risks of adolescent pregnancy (Breuner et al., 2016).

The development team has failed to meet the ethics code principles, some of them being very similar to BCS Code of Conduct (BCS). For example, the aforementioned issue related to sexual education, violates rule number 1. of the public interest section, which states clearly that you shall have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment. Rule number 3. of the same section, clearly prohibits from discrimination. In the case of blocking gay and lesbian marriages information, it can constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation, which again, is against the BCS code of conduct. 

While I believe that none of the shortcomings Blocker Plus’ system had were put in there intentionally, it is the outcome that matters. Unfortunately the outcome was a material breach of several ethics code principles as well as BCS code of conduct.

#### Summary Post

After reviewing the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018) I have shared my views and opinions in the initial post, to which I got one reply (Dervishev, 2023) posing a question about potential application of gestures in a machine learning algorithm that would be able to estimate user's age and based on this apply a filter to the content accessed on a given device (Pulfrey & Hossain, 2022).

This question opens further considerations to what was explained in initial post, and my personal opinion is that this feature could be of a great usage - if properly applied, however it can be very tricky and potentially cost the companies its customers, if the rate of error would be too large. I am considering here a legally sane adult (in the eyes of the law) who would like to enter websites where, for example, alcohol is sold. Such adult might get frustrated if they are denied access and have no way of switching off this child-protection algorithm. Therefore it is crucial that such considerations are made before rolling out the product for the wider use. 

To sum up the discussion in this thread, we all agree that tools for protecting children in the internet are needed. Some content should simply not be accessible for them, as indicated by Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) in the US. It is however crucial that such systems are provided with sufficient capabilities as to be protected from malicious attacks such that they are not infected with content the children should not see, or that the children are restricted access too, although they should not be. They should also allow for actual adults to switch off any restrictions if they are incorrectly applied to an adult by an algorithm which determined the user is a child.

### Collaborative Learning Discussion 2
#### Initial post

When it comes to Abi’s concerns, first of all, there is no justification, whatsoever, for changing the data values - this is, to simply put it: fraud. Providing misleading information, especially when it comes to the commercials which reach the general public, is punishable by law in Poland (Dz.U.2022.0.1138 t.j - Kodeks karny) with a prison sentence from 3 months minimum to 5 years maximum. Apart from that, one can also face an immediate dismissal at their workplace. Not to mention the social impact of marketing based on false data. Commercials which reach millions of people, can mislead millions of people and hence have a tremendous impact on eg. public health. In Abi’s case we learned that Whizzz cereal may be harmful. It is scary to imagine if that turned out to be true - we could have overcrowded hospitals (in the worst-case scenario) for the mistake of this one person falsifying data reports.

Statistics are an extremely powerful tool, when used appropriately. They provide a variety of tools and techniques for data handling that allow a data professional to extract meaningful insights from even a ‘messy’ dataset (Grilli et al., 2023). However, when used inappropriately, they can skew results, hide important facts and mislead the reader. Therefore I believe that Abi shall choose the best suited tools and correlations for the task at hand, as objectively as possible, to the best of his knowledge, and these should be the ones making it to the report, regardless of whichever side they support. 

When it comes to responsibility, I wholeheartedly believe that the responsibility would lay with Abi only if he knowingly provided inaccurate results, or the ones achieved without following the ethics. One cannot be blamed for misinterpretation of their work by others, as long as one has provided accurate information, presented in a way which suggests correct interpretation of the results beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore it is within Abi’s best interest to follow the ethics, provide the results along with their correct interpretation. This - I believe - is the only ethical course of action in Abi’s situation.

#### Summary Post

It is clear that apart from the ethical concerns, there is a question of legal implications of providing false information. As it is usually the case, not only statistics are not black and white but also the legislation around it. I think we cleared any doubt, that providing knowingly false report on the analysis is unethical (Stahl et al., 2016). Depending on additional circumstances, such as whether or not there is some financial or any other gain involved for providing this false information, there can be even a prison sentence for person doing that, at least according to the Polish legislation (Dz.U.2022.0.1138 t.j - Kodeks karny).

One must take all necessary precautions when working with data, especially when it reaches a wider group and can influence people's purchasing behaviour. Inaccurate information not only can have legal repercussions (Dz.U.2022.0.1138 t.j - Kodeks karny) but also could be damaging to the public's health. Therefore it is of utmost importance to apply all of the best practices when analysing the data, create a plan of analysis before hand (such that it is not changed based on favourable or unfavourable results of the to date analysis) and make sure that the work is peer reviewed in order to spot any mistakes one can make unknowingly.

## Unit 1 
In Unit 1 we discussed the scientific investigation (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020) as well as ethics in research (Bailey et al., 2013). We focused on answering important questions, such as “What is the purpose of research”? I learned about the reasons behind conducting research (QuestionPro, 2021) and I had my first chance to interact with other students during the Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (which has a separate section dedicated to these discussions only). It was my first proper encounter with the rationale behind a researchand I must say it was much different to the research I was used to in my professional life (NotedSource, 2023). Commercial research looks much different to the academic one - I will explore this topic in the reflection on research methods further.

#### Tutor feedback:

- It is good to see you cite regularly in the early stages of the formative, ensure that you continue to do this for all future formative and summative but cite all the way through your discussion
- When using a quote, cite immediately after it [reference where the quote came from]. Do this in all instances
- Your citation thins out from section 3 onwards - you need to cite in every paragraph and draw theoretical discussion through the whole of the formative. Taking this approach means you develop a critical method of writing. You need to regularly compare pros and cons of research and investigation for criticality to occur, other wise your writing is descriptive
- Your list of references needs to be in alphabetical order

The main point is the issue of criticality and citation, and so don't merely interpret the research you have found - analyse and evaluate your research look at the limitations and positives of your research and develop your critical discussion from that aspect.

#### Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing

##### 1. Introduction
I have been tasked with reviewing Stahl et al (2016) as well as Bott (2014) Chapter 1. Stahl et al (2016) writes that many of the papers researching ethical issues in computing “fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders”. The task at hand is to imagine being a computing stakeholder at a company of choice and to examine one or more ethical issues mentioned in Stahl et al (2016) paper. Bott (2014) provides an overview and introduction into what law is, primarily focusing on the legislative and jurisdiction processes in the UK and in the US.

For the purpose of this task, I will choose to be a Software Engineer at Apple Inc.. The choice of the company aims to provide the reader with a very well-known company globally, which products the reader may have used in the past or is using currently. The choice of a Software Engineer is also aiming at providing a simple point of reference as to the scope of the work required by such professionals (Shweta et al, 2022). I will also generalise the daily tasks of a Software Engineer at Apple. It is important to note, that I do not have full information of what a day-to-day of a Software Engineer at Apple entails (as that is confidential). 

This task has no strict word count limit, however it is recommended to create a submission of a length of approximately 2/3 pages (around 1000 words).

##### 2. Ethical issues choice
The ethical issues I chose start with a widely discussed privacy issue (Zimmer, 2010) and the usage of user collected data for reasons the users may have not provided a specific consent. This brings a question of “what an online consent really is” (Varnhagen et al, 2005). It is worth noting that the two papers in no way will represent the full range of ethical issues involved with mentioned topics but rather provide a high level, introductory view on them. As tempting as it is to delve further on the topic, I must keep in mind the advised word limit for this paper.

##### 3. Effect of ethical issues on my role in the company and actions to be taken
First thing that comes to mind is the security of the software that I will produce. When it comes to privacy, the first and most important task is to secure any information that we collect from the users. I can therefore make a security and penetration testing review mandatory, before shipping any piece of code. 

Once I make sure that the information is protected, it should be reviewing what is actually the information that the software collects and whether or not the user has given their informed consent for collection of said data. In order to define what an “informed” consent really is, I shall refer the reader to the definition provided within the field of Medicine, where it is well established, practised and enforced by law for decades (Gossman et al, 2022). It is of a great significance not only to receive the consent, but also that it is an informed one. For this reason, I shall establish a process for reviewing any piece of code that changes in any way any of the information collected and evaluate such changes against the ethics code first. If there are no internal guidelines for ethics within the company, I shall propose to the management to establish one. 

Once the developed code meets the ethics standard, I shall work with UX/UI designers and copywriters to create a new consent request to the user which will be delivered in a way that allows them to make an informed decision. Such consent prompt shall appear prior to collecting any new information to which the consent has not been previously granted.

For all the above-mentioned processes I shall not only incorporate them in my tasks, but also make sure that the management adheres to them and sets appropriate structures, procedures and processes in place that allow for their execution by other software engineers as well. 

##### 4. Legal, social and professional impact of the aforementioned actions
###### 4.1. Legal impact
The Federal Trade Commission in the US is a body which can fine Apple, if they do not adhere to the actions in regards to eg. informed consent. The same goes for privacy and data collection as shown by several precedents (Richie et al, 2022). When it comes to collecting data from users within the EU, if Apple was not to adhere to GDPR standards when collecting and handling user data, they could be fined up to “€20 mln or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher”. The aforementioned actions are some of the ways to prevent such fines.

###### 4.2 Social Impact
Providing a clear, informed consent structure to the user prior to collecting their data may greatly influence customer’s experience and hence brand’s trust, which may be profitable for Apple (Meng Na et al, 2023). It will also allow the users to feel more secure knowing that they consented to the data that is collected on Apple’s devices but also by being sure that their data is well protected from exploitation. 

###### 4.3 Professional impact
The impact of introducing new/additional procedures and checks as well as involving other experts when eg. creating a new consent prompt, will have its costs. The most visible impact will be longer code shipping time - if the code has to undergo additional, sometimes complex checks before being released to the production environment, it is natural that the release process will take longer. It does also impose on the management the responsibility for governing the processes themselves as well as to “police” in some way, making sure that those who do not adhere to the procedures will be fined. It is crucial that Apple finds the right balance between punishment and turning a blind eye on the issue. It is also important that the employees feel inspired to follow these processes (do not follow them out of fear per se) as well as to report lack of someone’s adherence to them. 

##### Summary
Ethics in Computing are becoming increasingly important as the technology develops and more aspects of human life are in some shape or form digitalised. This paper provided a high level overview on the ethical issues related to data collection and privacy, while highlighting impact on legal, social and professional issues. Companies, like Apple, adhering to the ethics code may see slower release times and potential impact on their revenues initially, however the increased customer’s trust and brand loyalty may compensate for such a loss with a significant surplus. It does appear therefore, that there is no reason, not even financial one, not to adhere to ethics code in computing.

## Unit 2

In Unit 2 we spent some time familiarising ourselves with research questions and assignments that we needed to complete during this module, namely: Literature Review and Research Proposal Presentation. I particularly liked the quote provided by University of Essex and so I am going to quote it here as well: ‘The good researcher is not ‘one who knows the right answers’, but is ‘one who is struggling to find out what the right questions might be' (Phillips & Pugh, 2010). I spent some time reading about preparing research papers (Marble Jar Channel, 2018) and diving deeper into projects in the computing space (Dawson, 2015). I was a part of many computing projects, but as I was mostly working in start ups I found the guide (Dawson, 2015) to be much more rigid, structured and organised thatn a start up reality. Start ups work in a fast paced manner with little to no limitations, constraints or structure imposed, in order to move fast (Slávik, 2019). 
During this unit, I continued the discussion on the forum mentioned in Unit 1 and started planning my Literature Review submission (namely: selecting a topic from an approved list). You can find below the Literature Review Outline that I prepared during this unit.

### Tutor feedback:

Thank you for submitting your formative.

Noted that you speak of two definitions in the context of your discussion:

1) All technology jobs regardless of the profile of a company
2) All jobs (regardless of the job profile) within a tech company

For the Literature review choose one of these as you only have 2,000 words to discuss this. Similarly when
answering the Literature Review don’t break it down into too many subsections, again because you only
have 2,000. Keep the content concise and focused. Good to see you have started to add citation – ensure
for the actual Literature Review, that you ensure you have a good cross-section of secondary research
resources to enable effective critical debate to take place.

### Submission
The pdf format of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/literature_review_brief_PSieminski.pdf)

For the literature review I have selected the following question: “What is the gender pay gap
in the technology sector in the country of your choice?” with my country of choice being the
United States of America.

The first thing I would like to discuss in my literature review is the definition of the question.
More specifically, what does it exactly mean “the technology sector”. For me it means
technology jobs in technology firms. There exist however two different definitions:

1) All technology jobs regardless of the profile of a company
2) All jobs (regardless of the job profile) within a tech company
   
I find it extraordinarily important to clarify this first and foremost, as such distinction will
have a profound impact on the actual research. Following the definitions, I would state my
personal hypothesis about the gender wage gap in the technology sector in the US.

Once I clarify this and other terms (where necessary) I would like to move on to introduce a
bit of history and related legislation, in order to provide a wider context for the review and
subsequent research. I would like to review The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Equal Pay Act of
1963) and some of the historical data. Later on, I would like to introduce the timeframe
within which the literature review will take place. It is crucial to select a proper timeline and
to introduce the reader into the reasons behind such selection. As the technology sector is
rapidly growing and expanding, so are the jobs and pay within that sector (Sadler, 2023).
I am leaning towards looking at the last 5 years of data, which is motivated by the
aforementioned growth of the sector. It has also been the COVID-19 pandemic that has
affected the pay and the work set up, productivity and others greatly (Patanjali et al., 2022)
which is another reason for such a short time frame selection.

I would then proceed to the classification of academic sources to be reviewed. The
classification would likely follow a hierarchical structure, with the first and most important
distinction being the literature on actual measurements vs the literature on reasons behind the
gender pay gap or its social ramifications.

After classification, the summary of the reviewed literature should be produced, together with
key takeaways. Assessment of the initial hypothesis, summary of the key factors contributing
to the gender pay gap and so on and so forth.

It will be important to then review actions taken by corporations that aim to reduce the gender
wage gap and assess their effectiveness. Following this paragraph, I would like to discuss the
limitations and any shortcomings of the existing literature on the topic, along with
highlighting what could be the most useful area of research which would improve the state of
existing literature.

I would, subsequently, proceed to the conclusions section, with summary of the literature
review as a whole, as well as key takeaways for society to take into account for the future.

## Unit 3
In Unit 3 we analysed research methods as a part of the research design. We learned how important a good plan is for the research (Saunders et al., 2012) We distinguished 2 types of research design: exploratory research and conclusive research as well as 3 types of research methods: qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. I have encountered these research methods in my professional practice and the same comments can be made as with previous units descriptions. I will also dive deeper into the differences between research in the research process reflection at the very end of this portoflio. At the end of this Unit, we were asked a question to reflect on, to which the answer you can find below.

### Reflection question

_Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
Which data collection methods would you consider using?_

This piece of writing is to be considered as my personal thoughts and hence it will have a less academic form and will rather describe my thought process and considerations.
After assessing accessible topics for literature review from Unit 1 I have decided that I would like to focus my attention on the following topic: “What is the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the country of your choice?” 

The choice of the topic comes from the fact that not only is this an interesting question in and of itself, but also the technology sector has its peculiarities which might give very different answers to the gender pay gap question compared to if it was to be assessed in another industry. The technology sector, for example, does not require formal education (Gregory, 2022). Also, from my professional experience, I have often seen women earn the same, sometimes even more than men, for doing the same kind of work, within the technology sector. The gender pay gap question, generally assumes that the gap  is structured in such a way that men earn more than women (European Parliament, 2020). While this might be true globally, the literature review question is very specific about the technology sector. Having mentioned my professional experiences it is an extremely interesting topic for me to discover. I wonder if the gap exists in the technology sector, and if so, is it the same, smaller or maybe higher than somewhere else? Is it men who earn more or maybe women? What could be the causes for that?

I am still considering which country I want to review, but the US market seems like the most interesting one. The reason for that is that the gender pay gap there (Greenwood, 2023) seems to be as high as within the highest countries of the EU (European Parliament, 2020). The US market is also paying the most for the tech jobs (Philips, 2022) which creates more possibilities for the pay gap. My thinking here is that the more an individual can earn on average, the higher the standard deviation. That is an assumption I will also look to confirm or disprove.

When it comes to the methods I think the best would be to apply quantitative methods for this particular research. Reason being, that it might be hard to do qualitative research (unless some found online) as I am not physically present in the US. The gender pay gap question also can be primarily answered with numbers. Even the question contains the word ‘gap’ which indicates that a gap must be measured in some way, and quantitative research allows us to get the best guess at a true gap. Qualitative research could be very useful when it comes to understanding the reasons for the gap (if one is proven to exist). If I, however, won’t be able to find eligible respondents online, I will need to review the literature from the realm of psychology, which could, potentially, help me understand the reasons behind a gap (if one is proven to exist). Therefore the data collection would be mostly from publications and statistics, but also, if proven to be possible, some kind of survey that could be answered by eligible respondents and give more insights into the research. 

To sum this up, I do feel that this is an extremely interesting topic and I am looking forward to reviewing the literature and finding answers to all of the aforementioned questions.

## Unit 4
In Unit 4 we discussed data collection methods that can feed our research process. We learned about focus groups (Devaul, 2020), how to observe participants (Abramson et al., 2020) and most common observation methods (Fuelcycle, 2019). I was already familiar with these collection methods, however I learned something particularly interesting about the observation of participants - the interviews that one may conduct would be mostly unstructured and informal. It makes sense now that I think about it but it was a great learning I took from this unit (Abramson et al., 2020). Continuously the emphasis was put on ethics in research, especially when it involves people (Vanclay et al., 2013). At the end of the unit I have completed a formative activity which you can find below.

### Case Study on Privacy

The pdf format of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/unit4_case_study%20(1).pdf)

In Unit 4 we were given a case study (University of Essex, 2023) with intriguing questions to come up with answers to. Privacy is a key part of ethical considerations in academic research (Dawson, 2015). I would like therefore to answer each of the questions and give them the necessary attention. 

First and foremost, when it comes to privacy and data protection, there are legislative requirements to ensure safety and protection of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from external researchers and anyone else who does not have the right to access such data (GDPR, 2016). In the given case, Ricardo is not the person responsible for determining allowable access and therefore he should not release the PII data requested under no circumstances. It would have to be processed and approved by a legal department of Ricardo’s institution first.

Assuming that Ricardo is actually responsible for determining allowable access to the requested PII data, there are still very important ethical considerations to be done. On one hand, the researcher asks for the PII data in order to be able to request approval for further processing of the data from specific homeowners. This action alone is the correct approach when selecting a population sample to study (Dawson, 2015). What is problematic however, is that this data is not publicly accessible. In order to access this data, it must be retrieved from a stored and protected government database. These people might not want this data to be released in the first place and this is the biggest ethical concern.

For the last question, we shall assume that the institution holding the PII data and the researcher have followed the ethics code (Polish Academy of Sciences, 2020) when making the information accessible to Beth. Given the described scenario, where one-third of the population studied gave permission, one-third denied and one-third did not respond, there are very few options left for Beth. Since she does need at least one-half of the individuals to make a valid study, an attempt can be made to follow up with the group that has given no response. It goes without saying that Beth should not contact the individuals who denied again. This seems as far as Beth can go with the current data available.

There exists another solution which would be to ask the local government to release more names (if possible, following the same ethics standards as before). If that was not to be possible, then Beth should inform the individuals who gave consent, that the study cannot be concluded due to not enough respondents giving their consent. Subsequently Beth could move the study to another, possibly greater area, where the population size is higher and therefore the relative share of the population needed to make a valid study could be proportionally smaller. 

Following the ethics code (Polish Academy of Sciences, 2020) is not only crucial to successful research but is also a complex task. One must be aware of all implications of one’s actions. Even if, as described in the third paragraph, requesting consent for the study is the proper, ethical approach, there remains the question how does one access the names and/or other PII data necessary to request such consent. Such situations shall be studied with care and give proper attention in order to make sure that the ethical standards are upheld at all times.

## Unit 5
In Unit 5 we looked at interviews and survey methods. I am fairly acquainted with those from my professional career, but to complete my knowledge I followed up on the required reading (Berenson et al., 2015; Dawson, 2015; Confessore, 2018) and I was glad to work on another case study, discussing inappropriate use of surveys. Please find below my submission.

### Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

The pdf format of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/Case%20Study_%20Inappropriate%20Use%20of%20Surveys.pdf)

#### Introduction

The Cambridge Analytica case, as described by N. Confessore (Confessore, 2018) is presumably the first ever use of personal data on scale to inform a political campaign (build voter profiles, to be exact). I was tasked to consider how this could have happened and why it was used. The particular attention should be drawn to the use of innocuous Facebook surveys, as requested in the case study description. As I would like to keep this case study apolitical and strictly case-focused, I will refrain from naming any specific political party. I will focus on a general use case of such voter profiles and then proceed to discuss the ‘how’ and the ‘what for’ questions. 

#### What is a ‘voter’s profile’?

I would like to start with the definition of the voter’s profile. I like to think about it in a similar way as data professionals think about customer personas (Gilliland, 2017). It is a set of attributes which are used to group users into cohorts that are meant to be representative of a population. Such simplification can enhance any marketing (or political campaign) efforts. It makes it easier for a human to visualise and conceptualise an imaginary person (profile) as if they were standing in front of them. This makes it much easier to deliver the content that such a person is likely to want to hear. 

The concept of targeted marketing (buyer persona) has been around since 1999 (Zambito, 2010) and has since evolved significantly. Customer profiling (Loshin et al., 2013) can enhance understanding of a company’s users (Jansen et al., 2020) in the same way as a voter's profile can enhance a candidate’s understanding of the people who might or might not vote for them. It is therefore clear that there is a tremendous value in possessing such a voter's profile. The issue begins where we start looking into how the source data for profiling has been collected. 

#### How was the data accessed?

The case study description suggests (University of Essex, 2023) that the data used by Cambridge Analytica was taken mainly from Facebook surveys. In reality, it has been harvested from Facebook in one of the biggest data leaks in history (Confessore, 2018). Now that we have a clear understanding of where the data comes from, let us consider how that happened. I will leave to cyber security specialists any detailed analysis on how exactly this much data could have been harvested from secure Facebook servers and I will focus on the surveys mentioned in the case study description (University of Essex, 2023).

As N. Confessore rightly points out (Confessore, 2018): ‘You are the product’. In the evolving world and the Internet of Things reality, we share more and more of our data. Often unconsciously, sometimes by mistake but rarely with a pure intention, making informed decisions to supply our information to create profiling for monetary, political or any other gains. If something is for free it is likely that we are the product (Roy, 2018) and more precisely the information about us. I believe the participation in said surveys took place only because they looked innocuous, hence no one suspected that it might be used for informing a political campaign. 

#### Target pregnancy prediction model

Another example of a misuse of surveys and a variety of other data sources about a customer can be found within one of the biggest chain stores in the US: Target. Target has made the headlines when the company became ‘aware’ of a teen girl being pregnant before her father did (Hill, 2012). This information was predicted by Target’s ML model being trained on vast amounts of data and creating customer profiles in return - similar to those described at the beginning of this paper. 

It is self-explanatory that for-profit companies exist indeed for profit and therefore are always finding new ways to increase their sales and margins. When it comes to data, however, the ethics question comes to mind immediately, especially in the case of a teen pregnancy described above. We, as a society, have recognised that with growing accessibility of personalised data there is a growing ethical responsibility (Hemker et al., 2021). We shall look forward to seeing how this can be implemented on scale.

#### Summary

Inappropriate use of surveys is unethical in its definition. If it is inappropriate, then it is almost certainly unethical. It can have profound social and legal implications. In the case of Cambridge Analytica (Confessore, 2018), the misuse has triggered investigations from the highest structures of government in both the US and the UK. The world had seen Mark Zuckerberg (the Facebook CEO) in front of the congress. The 2016 US election was questioned by many (Auchard, 2018). These are only a few of the legal implications such an inappropriate use of surveys can have. 

It is not free from social and professional implications either. In Target's case we have learned about customers being ‘creeped out’ by the algorithm (Hill, 2012), which can negatively impact customer’s trust to the brand and to the industry in general, which in turn can have overall negative effects on the economy. Needless to say what social impact can cause an election that is questioned. It can lead to mass protests, sometimes violent (Kishi et al., 2020). It can lead to periods without a government which again, can negatively impact a country’s economy and various other aspects of social life. 

It is therefore clear that inappropriate use of surveys and other kinds of data has all sorts of negative implications, which we shall avoid at all costs.

## Unit 6 
In Unit 6 we discussed questionnaire design - again a field I am very well familiar with from my professional experience (hence not much critical review I can provide), nevertheless I was glad to read a guide on structure of the questionnaire (Brace, 2013). In this unit I was asked to reflect on the data collection methods appropriate fro my Literature Review submission and you can find this reflection below.

### e-Portfolio update: Data Collection

I have chosen to focus on the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the US. Because of that, I can see three main data collection tools which will be useful for my area of investigation. 

First and foremost it would be quantitative data pulled from official sources, such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, 2023). This will be the skeleton and the raw facts on which further investigation can be based. I would like to perform a statistical analysis on this data in order to validate the initial hypothesis (yet to be formulated) and check for statistical significance of the data provided (Schwen et al., 2018). Ideally, I would be able to identify clear tendencies in the data which will guide further questions.

Once raw facts are established, well defined and presented, the following data collection tools can be applied to enhance the understanding of the factual data: interviews and surveys (Ongena et al., 2020). These tools can prove very useful when trying to make sense of the numerical information. As we are human beings and we all have emotions, feelings, experiences that guide our careers (Emmerling et al., 2003) in one or the other way, it would be important to understand if the gaps (if existent) in wages can be explained by differences in psyche, approach to the workplace or maybe childhood experiences.

I would like to leverage surveys in order to be able not only to reach a bigger sample of respondents but also to ensure that the key questions are indeed answered. The surveys will allow me to make sure that at least a given set of questions is answered in some way. Even if the respondents mark an inconclusive answer (like ‘other’ with no further detail) this will still be a valuable insight for me, that maybe the question was written in a wrong way or is actually not that important (Jeong et al., 2022).

When it comes to interviews, they will be extremely helpful in getting more context (Philipps et al., 2019) to both the factual and survey response data. I would like to use this opportunity to ask further ‘why?’ questions and dive as deep as possible into some of the concepts that may impact the gaps (if existent) in wages. I would like to analyse these interviews in such a way that would allow for categorising the answers, which might be tough. If that was to prove to be impossible or highly unreliable, I would use them as supportive evidence, with clear information how the data is collected and that it should not be treated as views of a certain population sample but rather as individual views and opinions which can help understand the gender wage gap (if existent).

## Unit 7 
Unit 7 was the deadline for my first summative submission - Literature Review. I also had the opportunity to learn about the qualitative research methods for evaluating computer information systems (Kaplan et al., 2005) which was interesting to me given some of the thought that I have given to the research proposal presentation about evaluating database performance. I was not previously thinking about using qualitative research methods for evaluation of the systems, but the lecture of Kaplan's take on it taught me a very important thing: no matter how good the technology might be, it will not work if the users decide not to use it. I take this learning with me for the future work. Below you can find my submission, tutor feedback and brief self evaluation of the Literature Review.

### Self evaluation of the submission
Working on the literature review was an interesting experience. I have found the topic of the gender pay gap to be extremely interesting but also lacking a lot of relevant literature. Given its wide media coverage one would think that the topic is thoroughly researched, but it turns out not to be the truth. 

I believe the Literature Review was clearly structured and cohesive. I touched upon some history and legislation related to the gender pay gap, practice and theory, as well as performed thematic analysis of the literature available for this topic. I agree with the Tutor’s feedback that I shall review the literature before committing to the topic (as one of the shortcomings of the literature was just that there was so little of it). I took this feedback on board for the next assignment - Research Proposal Presentation - which I will discuss in the relevant section. 

The next piece of feedback I received that I find very useful is about the formatting of the submission. Title, table of contents and references section - each should have its own page and this is the feedback applied to my next submission - Research Proposal Presentation. 

My work was highlighted in some places where Turnitin (anti-plagiarism software) has highlighted bits and pieces within different sentences and indicated, that similar words appeared in some of the other publications. I understand that this had to be taken seriously into the feedback and lowered my grade. I believe, however, that there are certain things that, if rephrased, will loose its proper meaning. Therefore, for the future, I shall mark in my work (where rephrasing is not favourable for the content) the publications that Turnitin sandbox spotted. I can honestly say, that all of the work submitted was written myself. I accept the fact, however, that after I reviewed the literature, certain phrases could have stayed in my mind longer than others and then naturally appeared in my mind as I was writing the text. The feedback point I took from this is to more dilligently check and review Turnitin sandbox report, then mark in text what was highlighted by Turnitin for reference.

Overall I am happy with the submission. I received some valuable feedback that I was able to take to my next assignment. This Literature Review exercise has also helped me to prepare for the capstone project and discussions with supervisors. This is an invaluable skill that I will take with me moving on to the final project of this MSc programme. 
## Unit 8
Unit 8 aimed to prepare us for the statistical work that will be required to successfully complete our capstone project. We were tasked with completing statistical exercises worksheets (that you can find below). These exercises where on the basic level (Berenson et al., 2015) and my previous experience with statistics was sufficient to complete these exercises at ease. These exercises were based on worksheets, which will be provided under relevant section. The outcome of these exercises, i.e. working files, will also be linked below. This is to ensure consistency in this part of the portfolio and avoid uploading text, where sheet calculations took place. I will describe each link uploaded below such that it is easy to follow and understand. Another, formative, submission, which was due in Unit 8, was the Research Proposal Outline. You can find the details of that below as well.

## Unit 9
In Unit 9 we dived deeper into the analysis of the qualitative data (BRM, 2021). One of my previous positions (in my professional career) was Senior Data Analyst. As such, I was faced with various problems, including analysis of social media documents (Schneider, 2018)), and data sets that needed analysing - both from qualitative and quantitative data. Therefore, this module was a refresher of the knowledge for me. At the end of the unit we were tasked with completing some chart exercises. These exercises were based on a worksheet, which will be provided below. The outcome of these exercises, i.e. working files, will also be linked below. This is to ensure consistency in this part of the portfolio and avoid uploading text, where sheet calculations took place.

## Unit 10
In Unit 10 we focused on the structure of the research writing and how to properly prepare for writing a dissertation (University of Essex, 2012). This unit was also the deadline for the Research Proposal Presentation submission which took a lot of my time but was a true learning journey. I was recording the required presentation several times in order to make it within the time limit - 15 minutes. I learned how to structure and pace my presentation to make it in time - extremely valuable skill for both academic and professional life. I felt like providing references on every single slide was damaging the visual quality of the presentation. I understand the need and requirements behind that, so this is not me disputing whether or not we should be doing, but it is my observation that it can decrease the visual perception of the presentation. You can find below the submission, tutor feedback as well as a short self evaluation piece. The submission piece has been originally submitted with audio and video, however the file size is too large to upload here, and because of that I will provide a link to the transcript as well as the slides.

## Unit 11

In Unit 11 we were given some time to spend reflecting on our academic and professional journey. We were given a Professional Skills Matrix, SWOT analysis and an action plan to complete. This unit has also guided us on how to prepare and structure this very e-Portfolio in which I am writing right now. The module puts emphasis on the importance of the e-Portfolio in the context of employability (Weber, 2018) as well as improved exam performance (Händel et al., 2018). Apart from the above mentioned I have also reflected on one module that I found the most beneficial throughout the course of this programme and you can find the links to all of the artefacts below.

## Unit 12

Unit 12 brought something a little bit unexpected for me, but extremely useful, namely project management (Maylor, 2010) and risk management (Marichetty, 2017) aspects. While I was a team member on many projects during my professional life, it was still great to learn more about concepts behind risk management in IT projects (McManus, 2012) and to expand my knowledge on agile methodologies behind project management (Mircea, 2019). At the end of the unit I have also completed a self-test quiz (related to project management) which you can find linked below.

## Statistical skills reflection
### Description
In order to reflect on my statistical skills I will apply Gibbs Reflective Cycle (Galli and New, 2022). During this the Research Methods and Professional Practice module we were tasked with completing statistical worksheets - an exercise aiming at preparing us to be able to work with data when undertaking the capstone project. The exercises provided there were easy to understand and follow, given my prior experience as well as previous modules during this MSc programme. They focused on understanding the distribution of the data, descriptive metrics, hypothesis testing, p-value and charts visualisations.
### Feelings
I feel that the exercises themselves did not bring any new knowledge to my existing skill set so I treat them more as a reminder and a refresher of my knowledge, given the upcoming capstone project. I think that for the computing programme, these exercises could have been on a little bit more advanced level. This is based on the assumption that everyone on the Master’s programme in the Computing department has this basic understanding of statistics. I would like to see some more challenging and thought-provoking exercises.
### Evaluation and Analysis
The topic of advanced statistics is something I encounter everyday in my professional life as I am currently employed as a Senior Analytics Engineer at an EdTech company which causes me to work with Data Scientists and their statistical work. Prior to this employment I held a position of a Senior Data Analyst, where I was mostly working with product data. It required analysis of several experiments run by the product team. Thanks to that I became quite fluent with experiment planning (Risberg Ellekjær and Bisgaard, 1998), power analysis (Myors and Murphy, 2023) and then several techniques of analysis, depending on the requirements. Techniques such as causal inference (Cunningham, 2021), K-means clustering (Jin and Han, 2011), sample stratification (Singh and Mangat, 1996) etc. This brings me to the evaluation point of my statistical skills, which I feel mostly improved when I was working on the Machine Learning module and not so much in the current module. At this stage I am confident to say that I regard my statistical skills as advanced and the exercises provided in this module were of no challenge to me. I believe the level I possess is sufficient for the successful completion of all of the statistical work that will be required when completing the capstone project.
### Conclusion and action plan
I felt that there was not much room provided in the statistical worksheets exercises other than interpretation of the results. We were given clear instructions on how to create charts and how to calculate descriptive metrics of the data. What could have been done differently, in order to challenge myself a little bit more, is to attempt to look at the question first, then try to complete it without the guidance provided in the exercise worksheets. I could have only then reviewed the guidance in order to check whether I have achieved the required results properly. This is going to be my plan of action for the next time I encounter such exercises as it will allow me to maximise the learnings even if I possess prior knowledge about the topic.

## The research methods process reflection
### Introduction
The research methods process is a fundamental component of any academic or professional inquiry. It is the backbone upon which the credibility and reliability of any research rests. This reflection aims to delve into the essential stages of my engagement, the implications of those experiences, and the forward path from here.
### Research question
The research methods process started for me with identifying a viable research question. While this task was made easier during the Literature Review (I was provided with a list to choose from) it proved to be much more challenging for the Research Proposal Presentation. During the Research Methods and Professional Practice module’s lecture casts I have learned about the different types of questions a researcher can ask as well as how to avoid posing inaccurate, vague or tendentious questions. 

I have learned through my Tutor’s feedback, that performing due diligence on the literature available for the topic before committing to a research question is necessary for the research to be viable. I have made a mistake of committing to a question (for my Literature Review submission) which did not have sufficient coverage in the literature. While this is one of the shortcomings I noted in my report, it would have been better to find a topic that has enough research available to perform a much more cohesive literature review. This is a learning I took forward with me to my next submission as well as I will take it forward to all of the future research, be that during my MSc programme or my professional career.

Around the same time when I was learning about these research questions, the Polish government announced a referendum with four questions to be answered by Poles. There have been multiple comments about the referendum being tendentious (Bujas, 2023; Batko-Tołuć, 2023; Bankier.pl, 2023; Skomra, 2023; Dąbrowska, 2023). I felt like it was a great, real world example for me to examine the questions that are asked in the referendum and then reach some conclusions that will enhance my understanding of what a good research question is. 

I, personally, agree with the opinion that the questions in the referendum (Bujas, 2023) were not set objectively. This experience allowed me to better understand the social implications of asking a question in an incorrect way. Not only has this referendum started a wide public debate in my country (Poland), but also prompted several Polish MPs to call for a boycott of the referendum and call it illegal (Gruszczyński, 2023). I will leave it to the public opinion and judiciary system to decide on the matter. The point I took from it is that setting the right questions in an objective way is of utmost importance - whether in the public referendum or in the research, which is also public and can later on be referenced by other researchers. Therefore it is crucial that the right direction is set with the right research question, which follows the ethics code of research (Polish Academy of Sciences, 2020 and Stahl et al., 2016)
### Research design
Subsequently, the research methods process describes the design to be followed when conducting a research. This step can only be progressed onto, once the research question is clarified and properly set. I learned about three different approaches to the research design: qualitative (Atkinson and Delamont, 2010), quantitative (Balnaves and Caputi, 2001) or mixed (Åkerblad, Seppänen-Järvelä and Haapakoski, 2020). 

I have encountered these methods in my professional career. Back when I was holding a position of a Senior Data Analyst and working with product data, marketing and customer insights specialists were running all sorts of research to inform the strategy and direction for the product development of the company I worked for. While commercial research differs from academic one, the idea of qualitative and quantitative research is the same. The main difference I see between academic and commercial research, is that the academic one is much more demanding in terms of the scope, following specific rules, reproducibility and generalisability. Commercial research stays within the company that performed it and therefore, as it is not shared with the public, it does not have to meet such high standards to which the academic research is held (Fritzlen, 2022). 

The professional practice allowed me to experience planning and execution of several commercial researches. Therefore I believe I had a fair understanding of what the difference between quantitative and qualitative methods is and how the research should be planned in order to achieve objective and viable results. As an outcome of the researches I took part in, the company I worked for was able to advance their product and increase customer satisfaction. I believe this was a great experience that set me on a proper way to only improve my research design skills when I attempt my capstone project.

The MSc Data Science programme is quantitative in nature. There are however topics, where qualitative research methods could be applied. My Literature Review submission was about the gender pay gap topic. If I was to conduct research on this topic, it would likely be a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. On the other hand, my submission for Research Proposal Presentation is describing a research which is fully quantitative. I have made a conscious decision to switch the research methods between these two submissions as I intended to learn as much as I could before going into the capstone project. 

Reflecting on this choice right now, I am very glad I made that decision. When I was going through the Literature Review, not only had I had to consider several qualitative methods for research, but also the publications on the topic were mostly qualitative in nature. It helped me to understand how to read these publications, how to categorise and make sense of them. On the other hand, the quantitative research for my Research Proposal Presentation brought an entirely different focus to my work. This one is much more focused on numbers and things rather than individuals and society.

I believe the collective experience from these two submissions and my professional career brought me to a point where I can confidently say I have a good understanding of how a proper research design shall look like.
Conclusion
The process as a whole has been a transformative journey for me. Coming from less rigid commercial research structures to the academic research guidelines was quite a step up - one that I enjoyed thoroughly. I have received valuable feedback from my Tutor which I incorporated immediately in my next submission. I have learned how to perform a literature review, how to read and interpret both qualitative and quantitative publications as well as how to critically evaluate that literature in order to provide an objective view on the matter. I am looking forward to my capstone project, where I will take all of the aforementioned learnings and experiences with me.

## Impact on my personal/professional experience reflection 
### Introduction
The MSc Data Science programme has been quite an experience so far. I would like to reflect on it as a whole, comparing it to my previous experiences and outlining any new skills gained as well as new friendships made. I will start with a brief introduction of my professional career journey and learnings. I will then proceed to evaluate the modules (except for the introductory one: The Data Professional, because I am acquainted with the profession having worked as a data professional for several years now) and their impact on my personal/professional life.
### Past experiences
Prior to enrolling into the MSc Data Science programme at the University of Essex, I was already working in the data industry for a few years. I have started my data journey with a Junior Safety Analyst position at Booking.com. Then I progressed to BI developer, then Senior Data Analyst (The EPAM Anywhere Editorial Team, 2023) and right now I hold a position of Senior Analytics Engineer (Arrington, 2023). This journey has allowed me to enter the industry at a strictly analytical point (performing data analysis most of the time) and then gradually moving towards the engineering of data (Coursera, 2023). My current position requires no analysis of data per se, but rather the analysis of systems, query performance, stakeholder requirements etc. 

This career path has helped me to grow strongly in the technical fields, learning several tools and programming languages to the proficient/expert level (Mahmudova, 2021). Languages such as: SQL, Python, Java, JavaScript, YAML, LookML and Jinja. It has also prepared me to work with analytics and version control related tools, such as Snowflake, GCP, dbt, Looker, Tableau, spreadsheets, DataBricks, GitHub and Jupyter (Ramadan, 2017). After completing my professional skills matrix it became clear to me that I have strong technical skills, while the biggest room for improvement is within soft and leadership skills. It is important to note, that while I was always (during my career) a part of a team, my work was usually individual with very few chances to develop something together with other people. Everyone in my team had a specific scope of tasks and we were a team for mostly administrative reasons. This is why I put emphasis on the team work which took place in two of the described below modules.
### Modules experiences and impact
#### Numerical Analysis
##### Experiences
The MSc Data Science programme is not finished yet, but I am currently approaching the capstone project and so that is a good moment to reflect on all of the taught modules. I must say that I have expected a little bit more from the Numerical Analysis module. It was supposed to prepare us mathematically to the challenges of the Data Science field (Hrycej et al., 2023). While we covered the basics such as hypothesis testing (Emmert-Streib and Dehmer, 2019) or some entry-level statistics (Agarwal, 2013), my professional experience taught me that there is much more to maths in this industry than that. Some examples will include causal inference analysis (Pearl, 2010), experiment evaluation (Voorhees and Harman, 2005) or asymptotic analysis (Murray, 1984). One of the reasons I started this programme is that I hoped to learn a bit more maths that could help me in my career, which unfortunately did not happen.
#### Research Methods and Professional Practice
##### Experiences
The same applies to the statistical worksheets which are part of the exercises required for my current module - Research Methods and Professional Practice. This module, however, as I understand, is standardised across all of the Master’s programmes and therefore I treat the statistical worksheets as a refresher before the capstone project. Speaking of the current module, I shall rather focus on all of the new and extremely valuable learnings that I gained from it. My Tutor’s feedback has been instrumental in helping me to improve my academic writing as well as the structure of my work; feedback about correct text or references formatting, due diligence required before committing to a research topic or academic integrity. I delved more into the specifics of this feedback in my reflection about the research methods process, nevertheless it is important to mention this in the general reflection as well.
##### Impact
My professional writing skills have improved significantly. I have taken all of the learnings with me not only from one submission to another (within the MSc programme) but also to my professional career. I have received feedback from my line manager, that the reports and presentations I prepare right now, have some better structure than before, with relevant references put in a correct place and appendix available for stakeholders who wish to delve further into the topic. I personally feel that this module’s experiences are imperative to the successful completion of the capstone project and I am very glad I had the chance to work on the tasks for this module.
#### Deciphering Big Data
##### Experiences
Deciphering Big Data module has not brought many new learnings either. As previously mentioned, I currently work as a Senior Analytics Engineer and therefore Big Data related tasks are part of my daily job. The exercises evolved around database design, ETL organisation and performance (Kimball and Ross, 2013) - all of the concepts I can fairly say I am very proficient in. 
We were organised in teams in order to prepare these database designs and final reports. This was the first experience during the programme of working in teams. While we lost points on the structure of the report (eg. format of the references) we have done a good job on the technical side of the task. This experience allowed me to make new friends as well, whom I am in contact with to this day (even though we are not currently enrolled in the same module).
##### Impact
While there was not much technical skills learning coming from this module, I did learn to better cooperate as a part of the team - as that was my first experience developing a project together (during the MSc programme). I can also say that my communication skills improved, because in my team every member was coming from another country. This brought differences in communication styles, organisation of work and even the most (supposedly) trivial things like accent or pronunciation - we all had to make an effort to make sure that everyone understands us and that we are on the same page organisation wise. I am glad to have taken these learnings with me, which impacted me both personally and professionally. Now I have a wider understanding of different cultural backgrounds and it is easier for me to communicate with people from other countries.
#### Visualising Data
##### Experiences
The Visualising Data module has brought some fresh perspective to my visualisation skills. While my past experiences have put me in a good place to start with, this module has introduced me to the structure and psychological reasoning behind selection of one visualisation over another (Wiebels and Moreau, 2023). Up until this point, I would make my choice based on intuition and empirical experience, without knowing the scientific reason behind some visualisations working better than others. I cannot appreciate enough the learnings about how to activate both brain hemispheres with the right colours (Schubert, 2005), how to follow the principles of data visualisation (Midway, 2020) or how to build effective dashboards (Karami, Langarizadeh and Fatehi, 2017). I am glad to say that my visualisation skills and understanding have improved after this module.
##### Impact
Similarly to the impact described for the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, the visualisation improvements have also caught the eye of my line manager as well as stakeholders I work with in my professional life. I do not build dashboards on a daily basis but I do create presentations and reports for the projects I am involved with. This module has helped me to keep my communication more concise and to introduce icons and GIFs into my corporate presentations which in turn made people more engaged. Thanks to that I received higher response rates to surveys sent after presentations I delivered as well as more feedback when I shared a report with a group at my workplace.
#### Machine learning
##### Experiences
Probably the most impactful module of all was the Machine Learning module. While I have encountered Machine Learning earlier in my professional career, it was during that module when I actually got to build my own, quite complex neural networks model (Saeed and Homenda, 2016), together with Rory who was my team mate at the time. I have learned from Rory how to approach the development of a machine learning module - structured, gradual improvements to the performance instead of attempting to fine tune everything at once. My interest in machine learning skyrocketed with reading about the history of machine learning and learning new algorithms - the detailed review of this module has been described in a separate reflection available [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/Machine%20Learning%20module%20-%20reflection.pdf)
##### Impact
This module has sparked my interest so much that I decided to team up with my friends and work together to create some open-source project that can bring some benefits to society. I describe that in more detail in the specific reflection mentioned above. Working in a team with Rory has brought more structure into my work which impacted how I approach problem solving in general. I am now able to solve problems in an organised manner, while logging all of the developments for future review and reporting. 
### Conclusion
The MSc Data Science programme has been a handful of experiences. While I expected a little bit more on the mathematical side of things, most of the modules had at least some learnings that impacted either my professional or personal life (sometimes both). I have definitely improved my academic writing greatly as well as structured my problem solving approach. The Machine Learning module has sparked so much interest that I decided to build an open-source project with my friends (once I finish the capstone project; the scope of the project is not defined yet). The programme has also taught me some psychological reasons behind the choice of how to visualise data - the usage of colours, palettes, saturation, charts types and so on and so forth. It transformed my approach to the visualisation, which was previously based on empirical experiences first, and now I have the background knowledge as well. I am glad I enrolled in the MSc Data Science at University of Essex and I am looking forward to completing my capstone project.
