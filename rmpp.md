## Collaborative discussions
### Collaborative Learning Discussion 1
#### Initial post
I have chosen to review the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018). Blocker Plus serves, in my opinion, a crucial role in children’s safety when browsing the internet. It is intended to block the content that is legally protected by the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA, 2000).

The issue at hand is that the machine learning based algorithm started to block the content that was not explicitly prohibited by the CIPA. Which raises a question: what has caused such behaviour? The algorithm was intentionally misled by a group of people acting with a purpose such that specific information was parsed to the algorithm in order to be marked as harmful for children. Amongst several topics being blocked, was information about gay and lesbian marriages. Not only was this topic not prohibited by CIPA, but it has also been found that age-appropriate sexual education is beneficial for children (Breuner et al., 2016).

This situation raises important questions related to legal and social issues as well as the professionalism of the Blocker Plus’ development team. One of the logical provisions of the law is that whatever is not forbidden, must be allowed. Looking from this angle, the development team would have done nothing wrong. This is where the ethics come in and why they are so important in computing professionals practice (and many others). The Blocker Plus, as indicated in the case study analysis, has failed to meet several ethics code principles. In essence, it has failed to provide sufficient security which in turn made the product not serve its intended purpose. With the products of such importance, which is protection of children from harmful content, one can argue that making such products work exactly as intended is a matter of the highest priority. 

The social impact of the issue, apart from distrust of the customers, can also be a delayed sexual education for children, which might have a negative effect on their knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases or increase the risks of adolescent pregnancy (Breuner et al., 2016).

The development team has failed to meet the ethics code principles, some of them being very similar to BCS Code of Conduct (BCS). For example, the aforementioned issue related to sexual education, violates rule number 1. of the public interest section, which states clearly that you shall have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment. Rule number 3. of the same section, clearly prohibits from discrimination. In the case of blocking gay and lesbian marriages information, it can constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation, which again, is against the BCS code of conduct. 

While I believe that none of the shortcomings Blocker Plus’ system had were put in there intentionally, it is the outcome that matters. Unfortunately the outcome was a material breach of several ethics code principles as well as BCS code of conduct.

#### Summary Post

After reviewing the Malicious Inputs to Content Filters case (Case: Malicious inputs to content filters, 2018) I have shared my views and opinions in the initial post, to which I got one reply (Dervishev, 2023) posing a question about potential application of gestures in a machine learning algorithm that would be able to estimate user's age and based on this apply a filter to the content accessed on a given device (Pulfrey & Hossain, 2022).

This question opens further considerations to what was explained in initial post, and my personal opinion is that this feature could be of a great usage - if properly applied, however it can be very tricky and potentially cost the companies its customers, if the rate of error would be too large. I am considering here a legally sane adult (in the eyes of the law) who would like to enter websites where, for example, alcohol is sold. Such adult might get frustrated if they are denied access and have no way of switching off this child-protection algorithm. Therefore it is crucial that such considerations are made before rolling out the product for the wider use. 

To sum up the discussion in this thread, we all agree that tools for protecting children in the internet are needed. Some content should simply not be accessible for them, as indicated by Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) in the US. It is however crucial that such systems are provided with sufficient capabilities as to be protected from malicious attacks such that they are not infected with content the children should not see, or that the children are restricted access too, although they should not be. They should also allow for actual adults to switch off any restrictions if they are incorrectly applied to an adult by an algorithm which determined the user is a child.

## Unit 1 - Reflective Activity

The pdf format of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/piotr1204Essex/piotr1204Essex.github.io/blob/main/research_module_source/unit_1_reflective_activity.pdf)

#### Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing

##### 1. Introduction
I have been tasked with reviewing Stahl et al (2016) as well as Bott (2014) Chapter 1. Stahl et al (2016) writes that many of the papers researching ethical issues in computing “fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders”. The task at hand is to imagine being a computing stakeholder at a company of choice and to examine one or more ethical issues mentioned in Stahl et al (2016) paper. Bott (2014) provides an overview and introduction into what law is, primarily focusing on the legislative and jurisdiction processes in the UK and in the US.

For the purpose of this task, I will choose to be a Software Engineer at Apple Inc.. The choice of the company aims to provide the reader with a very well-known company globally, which products the reader may have used in the past or is using currently. The choice of a Software Engineer is also aiming at providing a simple point of reference as to the scope of the work required by such professionals (Shweta et al, 2022). I will also generalise the daily tasks of a Software Engineer at Apple. It is important to note, that I do not have full information of what a day-to-day of a Software Engineer at Apple entails (as that is confidential). 

This task has no strict word count limit, however it is recommended to create a submission of a length of approximately 2/3 pages (around 1000 words).

##### 2. Ethical issues choice
The ethical issues I chose start with a widely discussed privacy issue (Zimmer, 2010) and the usage of user collected data for reasons the users may have not provided a specific consent. This brings a question of “what an online consent really is” (Varnhagen et al, 2005). It is worth noting that the two papers in no way will represent the full range of ethical issues involved with mentioned topics but rather provide a high level, introductory view on them. As tempting as it is to delve further on the topic, I must keep in mind the advised word limit for this paper.

##### 3. Effect of ethical issues on my role in the company and actions to be taken
First thing that comes to mind is the security of the software that I will produce. When it comes to privacy, the first and most important task is to secure any information that we collect from the users. I can therefore make a security and penetration testing review mandatory, before shipping any piece of code. 

Once I make sure that the information is protected, it should be reviewing what is actually the information that the software collects and whether or not the user has given their informed consent for collection of said data. In order to define what an “informed” consent really is, I shall refer the reader to the definition provided within the field of Medicine, where it is well established, practised and enforced by law for decades (Gossman et al, 2022). It is of a great significance not only to receive the consent, but also that it is an informed one. For this reason, I shall establish a process for reviewing any piece of code that changes in any way any of the information collected and evaluate such changes against the ethics code first. If there are no internal guidelines for ethics within the company, I shall propose to the management to establish one. 

Once the developed code meets the ethics standard, I shall work with UX/UI designers and copywriters to create a new consent request to the user which will be delivered in a way that allows them to make an informed decision. Such consent prompt shall appear prior to collecting any new information to which the consent has not been previously granted.

For all the above-mentioned processes I shall not only incorporate them in my tasks, but also make sure that the management adheres to them and sets appropriate structures, procedures and processes in place that allow for their execution by other software engineers as well. 

##### 4. Legal, social and professional impact of the aforementioned actions
###### 4.1. Legal impact
The Federal Trade Commission in the US is a body which can fine Apple, if they do not adhere to the actions in regards to eg. informed consent. The same goes for privacy and data collection as shown by several precedents (Richie et al, 2022). When it comes to collecting data from users within the EU, if Apple was not to adhere to GDPR standards when collecting and handling user data, they could be fined up to “€20 mln or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher”. The aforementioned actions are some of the ways to prevent such fines.

###### 4.2 Social Impact
Providing a clear, informed consent structure to the user prior to collecting their data may greatly influence customer’s experience and hence brand’s trust, which may be profitable for Apple (Meng Na et al, 2023). It will also allow the users to feel more secure knowing that they consented to the data that is collected on Apple’s devices but also by being sure that their data is well protected from exploitation. 

###### 4.3 Professional impact
The impact of introducing new/additional procedures and checks as well as involving other experts when eg. creating a new consent prompt, will have its costs. The most visible impact will be longer code shipping time - if the code has to undergo additional, sometimes complex checks before being released to the production environment, it is natural that the release process will take longer. It does also impose on the management the responsibility for governing the processes themselves as well as to “police” in some way, making sure that those who do not adhere to the procedures will be fined. It is crucial that Apple finds the right balance between punishment and turning a blind eye on the issue. It is also important that the employees feel inspired to follow these processes (do not follow them out of fear per se) as well as to report lack of someone’s adherence to them. 

##### Summary
Ethics in Computing are becoming increasingly important as the technology develops and more aspects of human life are in some shape or form digitalised. This paper provided a high level overview on the ethical issues related to data collection and privacy, while highlighting impact on legal, social and professional issues. Companies, like Apple, adhering to the ethics code may see slower release times and potential impact on their revenues initially, however the increased customer’s trust and brand loyalty may compensate for such a loss with a significant surplus. It does appear therefore, that there is no reason, not even financial one, not to adhere to ethics code in computing.

## Unit 3 - Research Proposal Review

At the end of Unit 3 of the module, we have been asked the following question:

_Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
Which data collection methods would you consider using?_

This piece of writing is to be considered as my personal thoughts and hence it will have a less academic form and will rather describe my thought process and considerations.
After assessing accessible topics for literature review from Unit 1 I have decided that I would like to focus my attention on the following topic: “What is the gender pay gap in the technology sector in the country of your choice?” 

The choice of the topic comes from the fact that not only is this an interesting question in and of itself, but also the technology sector has its peculiarities which might give very different answers to the gender pay gap question compared to if it was to be assessed in another industry. The technology sector, for example, does not require formal education (Gregory, 2022). Also, from my professional experience, I have often seen women earn the same, sometimes even more than men, for doing the same kind of work, within the technology sector. The gender pay gap question, generally assumes that the gap  is structured in such a way that men earn more than women (European Parliament, 2020). While this might be true globally, the literature review question is very specific about the technology sector. Having mentioned my professional experiences it is an extremely interesting topic for me to discover. I wonder if the gap exists in the technology sector, and if so, is it the same, smaller or maybe higher than somewhere else? Is it men who earn more or maybe women? What could be the causes for that?

I am still considering which country I want to review, but the US market seems like the most interesting one. The reason for that is that the gender pay gap there (Greenwood, 2023) seems to be as high as within the highest countries of the EU (European Parliament, 2020). The US market is also paying the most for the tech jobs (Philips, 2022) which creates more possibilities for the pay gap. My thinking here is that the more an individual can earn on average, the higher the standard deviation. That is an assumption I will also look to confirm or disprove.

When it comes to the methods I think the best would be to apply quantitative methods for this particular research. Reason being, that it might be hard to do qualitative research (unless some found online) as I am not physically present in the US. The gender pay gap question also can be primarily answered with numbers. Even the question contains the word ‘gap’ which indicates that a gap must be measured in some way, and quantitative research allows us to get the best guess at a true gap. Qualitative research could be very useful when it comes to understanding the reasons for the gap (if one is proven to exist). If I, however, won’t be able to find eligible respondents online, I will need to review the literature from the realm of psychology, which could, potentially, help me understand the reasons behind a gap (if one is proven to exist). Therefore the data collection would be mostly from publications and statistics, but also, if proven to be possible, some kind of survey that could be answered by eligible respondents and give more insights into the research. 

To sum this up, I do feel that this is an extremely interesting topic and I am looking forward to reviewing the literature and finding answers to all of the aforementioned questions.
