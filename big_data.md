### Initial Post

Tejada (2023) describes the ways of processing large quantities of data. In the current world, data is often described as the biggest assets a company may have (Abdulghany, 2022). But what is data exactly? How it is stored and processed? How do we ensure it is secure? Tejada (2023) provides a comprehensive description of Lambda and Kappa architecture. The distinction is made between batch and stream ("speed") processing. The essence of this distinction is it is not a distinction between different data types or sources, as it would usually be a case. Batch processing would happen in a FinTech company receiving settlement data for all transactions that happened a day before, for example. Streaming would be used for information that needs to be accessed in real-time - such as (using FinTech company for clarity again) transaction errors information. 

It is important to specify what the article talks about in order to be able to get a proper look at what message Tejada (2023) is trying to convey. The processing architecture described in the article concerns the events data and its backup (hot and cold storage). 

Now that we clarified the first point, we can move on to evaluation of "opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection." The opportunities with such vasts amounts of data are absolutely endless. The more we get the more we are able to build. HPE Experts (2021) discuss the monetisation of data which required mature data strategy within a company. The data a FinTech collects can help other companies build a profile of their potential customer and hence increase sales (all following GDPR and other legal regulations of course). 

Limitations we have with large quantities of data are latency and the physical storage. The machines are what builds a cloud and there is some finite space on earth to store such machines - this is the first limitation. The second one is speed - this is a technical limitation. Speed can be increased horizontally or vertically (Meli, 2021). Both of these scalings mean adding more computing power by adding new machines or extending capabilities of current ones. Because of this the limiation is either physical (as mentioned already above) or technological (what humanity is capable of building).

Risks with such large data processing seem quite obvious - data leaks and exposure of large number of people at once (Chin, 2023). If we do not take a proper care of the processing and security of IT systems responsible for such processing - malicious actors might steal the data and put at risk not only individuals but also whole states (if, for example, government critical infrastructure information is stolen during streaming). 

Challenges are tightly coupled with limitations. We ought to remember scaling clouds is not a free exercise. The companies can have access to Cloud storing and computing services, but everything comes at a price (Snowflake, 2022). The job of Analytics/Data Engineers (2023) in an enterprise is to provide the company with data it needs but also to optimise costs and efficiency as much as possible. With large quantities of data it is becoming a bigger and bigger challenge.
